Auto-tuning for best performance and efficiency, automatic selection and runtime automatic switching to most profitable cryptocurrency algorithm are all integrated into NiceHash Miner and will enable you seamless, joyful and profitable mining experience.

Features
Easy one-click CPU mining for CPUs that support at least SSE2 (only works on Windows x64).
Easy one-click GPU mining for NVIDIA GPUs using microarchitecture (compute capability) SM 2.1/3.x/5.x/6.x.
Easy one-click GPU mining for AMD GPUs using any AMD GPU devices that supports OpenCL.
Support for multiple CPUs on multiple NUMAs with affinity adjustments to maximize mining speed.
Integrated support for Simple Multi-Algorithm. Always mine most profitable algorithm.
Integrated benchmarking tool. Run it only once before you start mining and after every hardware/driver/software upgrade.

How to get&run it?
All you have to do is download, extract and run the miner (no installation needed), choose the server location that is the closest to your location, run built-in benchmark and enter your Bitcoin wallet address where you want to get your coins sent at - and you are ready to start mining and maximizing your profit.

Note: .NET Framework 2.0 or higher and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 is required. No additional installations should be needed if you use Windows 7 or later. However, if you encounter any issues when starting application (application would fail to start or errors/warnings about missing DLL files are displayed) you should download and install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 (vcredist_x64.exe) (after installation a reboot might be required).

Detailed instructions:

Download binaries from here: https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/releases
Extract zip archive
Run NiceHashMiner.exe
After first run, start benchmark test, otherwise Multi-Algorithm mining will not work properly; for AMD GPUs we suggest you to run Precise benchmark

You will receive Bitcoin payments according to our payments schedule: https://www.nicehash.com/index.jsp?p=faq#faqs6
WARNING: Due to specific requirements of the supporting back-end program "sgminer", you can not run NiceHash Miner through Windows RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) if you are using AMD GPUs. If you still wish to use remote access to your computer while running NiceHash Miner we suggest you to use TeamViewer: https://www.teamviewer.com.

Where is the profit coming from?
As a back-end NiceHash Miner relies on the NiceHash.com service. By running NiceHash Miner you're essentially selling the hashing power of your CPUs & GPUs to hashing power buyers. Those are using the hashing power to mine various cryptocurrency coins and support decentralized blockchain networks - similar to cloud computing - only that by running NiceHash Miner you're actually being a provider for the cryptocurrency mining hashing power. You are being part of a global compute power network, empowering decentralized digital currencies.

How to run NiceHash Miner only when profitability is high enough?
Profitability of mining can go up and down that may be unprofitable to mine especially places with high electricity cost. By using the "MinimumProfit" settings, NiceHashMiner will stop mining if the current profits are below the minimum amount (in USD). This will help you mine during "profitable" times only.
